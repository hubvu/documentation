## Overview

Ondat failure modes offer different guarantees with regards to a volume's mode of operation in the face of replica failure. 
- If the failure mode is not specified it defaults to `hard`. 
- Volume failure modes can be dynamically updated at runtime.

> ðŸ’¡  For more information on the replication and failure mode features, review the [Replication](/docs/concepts/replication) feature page.

### Example - Set Failure Mode to `soft` for a Volume

The failure mode for a specific volume can be set using a label on a PVC or it can be set as a parameter on a custom Ondat [StorageClass](/docs/operations/storageclasses).

> ðŸ’¡ A PVC definition takes precedence over a StorageClass.

Below is an example of a PVC resource that ensures that 2 replica volumes will be available and sets a `soft` failure mode.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-vol-1
  labels:
      storageos.com/replicas: "2"           # 2 volumes replicas will be available.
      storageos.com/failure-mode: "soft"    # `soft` failure mode is enabled.
spec:
  storageClassName: "storageos"
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```
