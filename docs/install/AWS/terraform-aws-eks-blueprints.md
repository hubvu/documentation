## Overview

The [Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints) is a collection of Terraform modules that aim to make it easier and faster for customers to adopt Amazon EKS. It can be used by AWS customers, partners, and internal AWS teams to configure and manage complete EKS clusters that are fully bootstrapped with the operational software that is needed to deploy and operate workloads.

Ondat has published an official add-on to the EKS Blueprints that allows the deployment of Ondat.  Access the add-on via the following GitHub repo: [terraform-eksblueprints-ondat-addon](https://github.com/ondat/terraform-eksblueprints-ondat-addon/tree/main/blueprints/getting-started).
