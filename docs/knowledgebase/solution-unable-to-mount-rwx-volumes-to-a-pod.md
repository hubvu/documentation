## Issue

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is bound and the Ondat volume appears to be in a healthy state, but the volume was never mounted to the assigned pod.
- Below is the error message that is returned in the `Events` section when you describe the pod.

```bash
# describe the "my-pod-mounting-rwx-volume" pod.
kubectl describe pod my-pod-mounting-rwx-volume

# truncated output.

```

## Resolution

- Check and ensure that there is a [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) for the RWX volume in the same namespace where the pod is located. If the service does not exist, a recommendation would be to follow the instructions below.

```bash
# Define environment variables.
PVC_NAME="my-volume-name"
PV_NAME=$(kubectl get pvc $PVC_NAME -ojsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}'))

# Get the PersistentVolume (PV) name associated to your PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
kubectl get service | grep $PV_NAME
```

- You can also use the [Ondat CLI](/docs/reference/cli/) to also check the health status of the volume. Notice that there is no assigned port under the `Service Endpoint:` key-value pair as demonstrated below;

```bash
# Use the Ondat CLI to describe the RWX volume which does not have a service.
storageos describe volume $PV_NAME

- Check and ensure that the ports in the range of `25705-25960` is accessible between the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. You can find more information on the ports required for RWX Volume Endpoints in the [Firewall](/docs/prerequisites/firewalls/) prerequisites page.

## Root Cause

- The error message is related to the fact that there is no `Service Endpoint:` for the RWX NFS server.
  - The Ondat Control Plane in the `storageos-node-xxxx` daemonset pod spawns a Ganesha NFS server that is bound to the host network on a port in the range [`25705-25960`](/docs/prerequisites/firewalls/). If the Pod cannot bound to the port for the Ganesha the `Service Endpoint:` value will show as empty.
